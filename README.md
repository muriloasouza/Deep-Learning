# Temporal Convolutional Multithresholded Multiregression for Power Systems Variables Analyses and Predictions
Data files and a tensorflow 2.0 Jupyter notebook for multiregression model using one dimensional CNN applied to Power Systems

Data set are split into training and validation as follows:

Input_Train.txt - Inputs for training

Input_Valid.txt - Inputs for validation

Labels_Train.txt - Output for training

Labels_Valid.txt - Output for validation

The available source code is the last version that gave the results presented in the paper.
